Version 2.0 is currently in testing / beta phase.  This can be downloaded in HACS be enabling beta releases.  Please test this out if willing to provide debug logs.   In the next month or so if issue reports are solved I will promote it to the main release.   So testing is appreciated.  This new version supports multi car multi brand as well as fixes core architecture that allows us to do things like set seat heat level and display this easily. Only large bug fixes will go to 1.X going forward.  New features and PRs are requested to go to the 2.0 branch as well. 


Warning: please do not set very low values for force sync because it will drain your battery. 
This integration is mimicking mobile app and you can face the same issue in the mobile app too.

I have baked a custom integration for Kia Uvo / Hyundai Bluelink, this will be working for new account types. Thanks for your hard work [@wcomartin](https://github.com/wcomartin/kiauvo). This project was mostly inspired by his [home assistant integration](https://github.com/wcomartin/kia_uvo).  This integration also consumes and models items after [Bluelinky](https://github.com/Hacksore/bluelinky), it uses stamps they have been able to create for EU.  We thank them for being pioneers on this journey. 

## Installation ##
You can install this either manually copying files or using HACS. Configuration can be done on UI, you need to enter your username and password, (I know, translations are missing!). 

- Region support has been added, you can test initial set of functionality for Canada and USA regions and share your findings.
- It will only fetch values for the first car, I am not sure if there are people outside using Kia Uvo / Hyundai Bluelink with multiple cars :)
- update - It will fetch the cached information every 30 minutes from Kia Uvo / Hyundai Bluelink Servers. **Now Configurable**
- force update - It will ask your car for the latest data every 4 hours. **Now Configurable**
- It will not force update between 10PM to 6AM. I am trying to be cautios here. **Now Configurable**

## Troubleshooting ##
If you receive an error while trying to login, please go through these steps;
1. As of now, integration only supports USA, EU and CAD region, so if you are outside, you are more than welcome to create an issue and become a test user for changes to expand coverage. USA coverage isn't complete. 
2. If you are in EU, please log out from UVO app and login again. While logging in, if your account was created in legacy UVO servers, they will be migrated to new Kia Uvo / Hyundai Bluelink servers. Related Issue: https://github.com/fuatakgun/kia_uvo/issues/22
3. If you have migrated recently, you might need to wait one day to try again. Related Issue: https://community.home-assistant.io/t/kia-uvo-integration-pre-alpha/297927/12?u=fuatakgun
4. As a last resort, please double check your account credentials or you can create a new account and share your car from main account to new account.
5. You can enable logging for this integration specifically and share your logs, so I can have a deep dive investigation. To enable logging, update your `configuration.yaml` like this, we can get more information in Configuration -> Logs page
```
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.kia_uvo: debug
```
